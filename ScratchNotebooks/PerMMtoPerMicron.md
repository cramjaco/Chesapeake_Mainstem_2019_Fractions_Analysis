# Statement of the problem
I discovered, after submission to a journal, that when I divide by bin-width, my units are generally in #/L/Î¼m but I've been reporting them as #/L/mm. I need to correct this in the code and in the manuscript.

Fortunately, this problem affects only units that I report things in and not any of the conclusions. I will fix everything here and in a draft of the manuscript. I may or may not ask the journal to send an update to reviewers.

The following figures need to be updated

Figure S2, all, MCN_Molarity.png --
Figure S23, all, bottomNS.png, oxyclineNS.png, surfaceNS.png

I need to comment the code so that when I define something as /L/mm, I clarify in the comments that the units are wrong.

I need to update the text in two places.
