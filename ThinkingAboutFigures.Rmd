Things that need to happen for the manuscript.

A good version of the Grace Martinez microscopy vs 18s plot. (Fig S1)

?Explore rolling in 5.1 Bottom

A figure of total microbial abundance vs size (per mass or per volume or both -- maybe both) (Fig 1)
Top and bottom

Some exemplars of taxon abundance patterns- 
A microbe that is most abundant on large particles per mass but not volume (one of clara's planktos for instance). Paracoccus sp (abundant on intermediate particles) a SAR11 (ostensibly free)
Top and bottom (six panels)

Plot each as relative abundance, cells/mg, cells/L/mm (Fig 2)

CCA of micobes vs size and location. (Fig 3)

Something about richness (and evenness). (Fig 4)

Brigandine plots -- phylum (Fig 5)
ASVs within some group. (Fig 6)
ASVs that are mostly on particles 20 microns or larger (Fig 7)
